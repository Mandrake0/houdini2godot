"""The Godot Scene Exporter export Godot Scenes and CSV Files"""

== Overview ==
The Godot Scene Exporter uses the Houdini Instance Functionality for Exporting Level Designs.
Basic Static Meshes Export is possible.

NOTE:
    Currently there are many Limitations!
    NO Export for Lights, Bones, Volumes and every other Funky stuff :-) 

@parameters

== Setup ==

Project Folder:
    #id: project_folder

    Set the Root Folder Path to the Godot Project

== Assets ==

Asset Folder:
    #id:asset_folder

    Folder Name to Export all Selected Assets
    
Asset Flag Type:
    #id: Asset Flag Type

    Selects the Geometry from the Flagged Node

Filename:
    #id: asset_filename

    The Export Filename, Default Filename is *asset.csv* 

== Instance ==

Export Object List:
    #id: export_object_list

    When Togglet active it will create the Object list Data File

Export Instance File:
    #id: export_instance_file

    When Togglet active it will create the Instance list Data File

Instance Object:
    #id: objpath1

    The Instance Node with the required Attributes.

    NOTE:
        Only these Point Attributes should exist: instance, P, N, scale

=== Optimisation ===

Floatingpoint Precision:
    #id:Floatingpoint_Precision

    Houdini Export Float's in a high Precision in most cases it isn't required in a Godot Scene.
    For Reducing the Filesize it makes sense to have this option active.

    Default is 5

    0.123456789 -> 0.12345

Float is Integer:
    #id:Float_is_Integer

    When a Float Attributte in a Vector can be converted to a Integer it will Converted.

    1.0 -> 1

    0.0 -> 0

Filename:
    #id: instance_filename

    The Exporting Instance Filename, Default Filename is *instance.csv* 

== Godot Scene ==

Scene File Export:
    #id:scene_file_export

Scene Folder:
    #id:scene_name

    Scene Folder to Export the Scene Data

Scene Filetype:
    #id:godot_filetype

    Define the Godot Scene File Type TSCN or ESCN

    TSCN:
        Editable Node File
    ESCN:
        Locket Node File
